title: How to program your Lego Bot with NXC (on a Mac)
excerpt: A quick guide to show how to use NXC when developing for Lego Mindstorm NXT on OSX.
---

When starting with Lego programing, Mac users are often met with difficulties when it comes to language selection. Whilst many languages exist that one could write mindstorm-programs with, not many are OSX compatible. In reality - the only viable option apart from the visual lego language is NXC.

Starting with NXC is however also a big hurdle if you're not used to working with the terminal. Here's where this short guide comes in.

## What you'll need
To get started with developing there's a few things you'll need.

* Your charged lego robot
* A text editor (I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) from Github!)
* A USB-cable

## Installation

Lets start off by downloading the files we need.

1. Go to [mindstorms downloads](http://www.lego.com/sv-se/mindstorms/downloads)
2. Scroll down to "NEDLADDNING AV NXT-PROGRAMVARA (PC/MAC)" and select the NXT Fantom driver.
3. Install the NXT Fantom Driver.
4. Go to the [bricxcc sourceforge page for NBC](http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/release/index.html) and download the latest executable for Mac
5. Extract the contents for the .tgz-file you just downloaded in a location of your choice.

## Using NXC and running the code

While developing, you write your code in a text editor as per the NXC documentation. When you want to try out the code on the robot, you do the following:

1. Open up a terminal and navigate to the folder. If you placed the contents on your desktop, the command you need to run will be `cd ~/Desktop/<name of the folder>`
2. Plug in your lego robot to your mac.
3. Run the following command and replace "file-path" with the path to your .nxc file. If you're having trouble finding the path, simply drag the .nxc file into the terminal window.
`./nbc -d file-path`

If you want to, you can replace the "-d" with a "-r" to execute the code automatically when it's downloaded to the robot.

That's all there is to it! Happy Hacking! :)
